The AI acknowledged this by confirming that it would work on adding these elements. Various additional features for the sidebar were suggested, including an expandable sidebar menu, a footer for quick navigation links, breadcrumb navigation, search functionality, a theme toggle button, and live chat support. The user indicated preferences for responsiveness and visibility regarding the sidebar's design across devices and its interaction behaviors.\n\nFor the navbar, additional features were proposed such as a sticky navbar, dropdown menus, a search bar, responsive design, a night mode toggle, and dynamic updates for the active navlink. The AI confirmed it would work on adding the navbar once again. Questions were posed regarding the placement and functionality of a \"Hello World\" button, with options about its screen position and the action it should trigger. The user also requested this button to simply display a \"Hello World\" message. Additional features for the app were discussed, including a real-time blockchain news feed, interactive network graphs, a trending blockchains carousel, a blockchain glossary, user account creation, and options for saving and sharing content. The AI acknowledged the progress on building the button that displays \"Hello World\" after the user provided this request, and then asked for more details about the project.",

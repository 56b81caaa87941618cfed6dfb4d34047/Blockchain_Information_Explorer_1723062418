The AI subsequently inquired whether the user had a specific design style for the navbar and if it should be fixed at the top of the page. The user was presented with two options for each question and was also offered a list of additional features for consideration, including a dynamic search field, a 'Latest News' section, and user authentication for personalized content. \n\nThe user confirmed they wanted the navbar added and provided additional feature preferences, including an expandable sidebar menu and search functionality. The AI acknowledged these requests and reiterated its commitment to implementing various features after further clarification. It later asked about the positioning and action of a 'Hello World' button that the user also wanted, showing a continuous dialogue where the AI consistently built upon the user's requests and provided options for customization.",
